# Handwritten-MNIST-digit-recognition-Neural-Net-
This project implements a robust deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the classic MNIST dataset. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, it demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Neural Network for high-accuracy image classification.
